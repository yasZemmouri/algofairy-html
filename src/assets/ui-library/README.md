# UI Library Documentation

## Introduction
This UI library serves as a centralized repository for reusable components intended to streamline the development of consistent and cohesive user interfaces within our projects.

## Goals and Objectives
- **Reusability:** Encourage the reuse of standardized UI components across the project.
- **Consistency:** Ensure consistency in design and functionality throughout the application.
- **Efficiency:** Speed up the development process by providing pre-built and tested UI elements.

## Library Functionality
### Component Scope
- Includes a range of components such as buttons, cards, forms, etc.
- Each component is designed for easy integration and customization.

## How it Works
### Component Structure
- Components are organized into separate folders, each containing SCSS and php templates.
- SCSS files follow a structured naming convention for easy identification and modification.
- To visualize the components run the showcase.php file http://localhost/algofairy-html/src/assets/ui-library/showcase.php 

## Implementation Guidelines
### Integration Instructions
1. **Run showcase.php:** Run showcase.php in the browser to visualize the components by folder name.
2. **Include Components:** Go to the designed folder and copy the php file in src/includes and link include it in the page that is using it. Copy the scss file into the src/assets/scss and import it in the main.scss file  .
3. **Customize (if needed):** Modify variables or mixins to customize component styles.

### Code Examples
#### Button Component Integration
```scss
// Import button component SCSS
@import 'path/to/ui-library/buttons/_button';

// Your custom styles or overrides
...

// HTML implementation
<button class="button">Click Me</button>
